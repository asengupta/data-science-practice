# Investment Assignment

## Running the file
If you wish to use your own copy of the data, use the following command:

```
python investment-main.py [{-c |--companies=}<companies-csv>] [{-r |--rounds=}<rounds-csv>] [{-m |--mappings=}<mappings-csv>]
```
Here are some examples:

```
python investment-main.py --companies=<companies.csv --rounds=rounds2.csv -mappings=mappings.csv
python investment-main.py --companies=<companies.csv --rounds=rounds2.csv
python investment-main.py --companies=<companies.csv -mappings=mappings.csv
python investment-main.py
```

All of these arguments are optional. Providing no arguments makes the code read from the default location, i.e. ```./data```.

## Instructions on regenerating the Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook can be regenerated by installing P2J, like so:

```
pip install p2j
```

and running the following:

```
p2j -o code/investment-main.py -t notebook/investment-main.ipynb
```
