# Bike Sharing Assignment

## Running the file
If you wish to use your own copy of the data, use the following command:

``python bike-sharing-main.py [{-i |--input=}<loan-csv>] [-h | --help]``

Here are some examples:

```
python bike-sharing-main.py --input=loan.csv
python bike-sharing-main.py -i loan.csv
python bike-sharing-main.py
python bike-sharing-main.py --help
```

All of these arguments are optional. Providing no arguments makes the code read from the default location, i.e. ```./data```.
